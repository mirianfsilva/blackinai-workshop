We also welcome papers about applications of AI to Health, Education, Fairness, Ethics and, Transparency in AI, AI & Arts, AI & Politics, etc.

Each submission will fall into one of these 4 tracks:
- Machine learning Algorithms
- Systems and Applications
- Position papers

Work may be previously published, completed, or ongoing. The workshop will not publish proceedings. We encourage all Black researchers in areas related to AI to submit their work. The work should include at least one Black researcher either as main author or co-author.
