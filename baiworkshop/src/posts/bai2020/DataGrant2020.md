### Important Dates:

1. NeurIPS Registration Fee Assistance Application due: Friday, October 23, 2020
2. Data Grants Due: Friday, October 23, 2020

**Data Grants:**
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the virtual nature of the Black in AI workshop this year, we are offering Data Grants to our participants who have limited access to the internet. We hope that this will make the workshop and conference more accessible to members of our community.

1. [Data Grant Application](https://forms.gle/yysGNGccAmV86iwF9) (Due  October 23, 2020 @ 5 pm EST)
**NeurIPS Registration Grants:**
If you haven't already registered for NeurIPS, then please do so [here](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020) as soon as possible. Conference fees have been significantly reduced but if the cost is still a burden then please for financial assistance at the link below. Black in AI will provide financial support to pay the NeurIPS registration fee. Note: If you applied directly to NeurIPS for assistance, then you do not need to apply to Black in AI as you will only receive one source of funding.
